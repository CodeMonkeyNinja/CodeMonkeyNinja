- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeMonkeyNinja (my real account is @HidekiAI)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that seems "fun" at the time of my research, but by trade, I've been a Video Game programmer since 1989.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning M.L. Computer Vision related, in particular, O.C.R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Rust related work, especially Video Games
- 📫 How to reach me: [https://github.com/HidekiAI/](https://github.com/HidekiAI/)
- 😄 Pronouns: Him/He/His/it/bit
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you want to get a real programming job, you need to know modern C++, and in a technical interview, NEVER mention functional programming if you suspect/sense that the interviewer has never sweated on FP, but rather just continue to praise OOP...
